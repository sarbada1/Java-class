//Interface


// -> abstract
// -> declare methods in abstract form
// -> declare only constants , no instance variables
// -> used to create loosely coupled structure
// -> interface being abstract is not allowed to create object
// -> a class can implement interface (one or more ) hence, interface support multiple inheritance
// -> interface creates a rule for implementing class to follow


// interface is a blueprint of a class , it is considered fully abstract

// marker interface :  interface without any abstract method or empty interface

//auto boxing- directly value lai box ma rakhne
// Integer i=100;

// int a=100;

//- primitives are fast in computation as they do not have extra layer to acess values
// but they lack in features or functionalities

// Inner class
    // -> Nested class
    // -> Static Inner class (as static member)
    // -> Method local Inner class (as a local member inside method)
    // -> Anonymous class
        // -> by extending another class
        // -> by implementing interface
